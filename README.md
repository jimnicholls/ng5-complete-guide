# Angular 5 - The Complete Guide

This is my project from working through [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/)'s [Angular 5 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2).

If you are looking for an example of someone just working through the course as instructed, **this is not it**. This is me working taking the project goals and steps, and "independently" trying to achieve thoses from what I've learnt.

The biggest difference between this code and what Max teaches and shows in the course is that I've used the [Clarity Design System](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/) for the UI/UX framework instead of straight Bootstrap.

## How to use this project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
